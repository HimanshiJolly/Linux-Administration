Others
Permission Types:
Read (r): Permission to read the file’s contents or list the directory’s contents.
Write (w): Permission to modify the file’s contents or add/remove files in a directory.
Execute (x): Permission to execute the file as a program or traverse a directory.

Changing Ownership:
chown: Change the owner of a file or directory.
